# mips32-single-cycle-cpu
the 32bit CPU which has MIPS architecture (single cycle processor)


## TODO
* 5-stage pipeline
* TLB
* address decoder (for memory mapped I/O)
* connect with SDRAM Controller (for Altera DE-10 Lite board)
* I-Memory and D-Memory set its width to 32bits, but it is not correct in some cases
* cache for I-memory and D-memory (modified harvard architecture)
